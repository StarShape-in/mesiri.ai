# Deployment Guide

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated CI/CD. Every push to `main` that passes tests is automatically deployed to the VPS. Two frontends are served from the same box on different domains:

- `mesiri.mercon.tech` — backend API + `control-panel` (internal admin UI, under `/mesiriadmin`). Config: `/etc/nginx/sites-available/mesiri.mercon.tech.conf` (tracked in the repo as `mercon.conf`).
- `mesiriweb.mercon.tech` — `apps/dashboard` (customer-facing web app), static files only, talks to the same backend cross-origin. Config: `/etc/nginx/sites-available/mesiriweb.mercon.tech.conf` (tracked in the repo as `mercon_web.conf`).

(The `mercon.tech` root domain itself is a separate, unrelated app on the same box.)

## How it works

```
git push → main
    ↓
GitHub Actions: deploy.yml
    ├── Unit tests (Python, fakes only)
    ├── Build control-panel (Vite)
    ├── Build dashboard (Vite, VITE_API_URL=https://mesiri.mercon.tech)
    └── Deploy (only if all above pass)
            ├── SSH → git pull origin/main
            ├── uv pip install (Python deps)
            ├── alembic upgrade head (migrations)
            ├── systemctl restart mesiri
            ├── Health check /health
            ├── rsync control-panel dist → /var/www/mesiriadmin/
            └── rsync dashboard dist → /var/www/mesiriweb/
```

If migrations fail or the health check fails after restart, the deploy step exits with a non-zero code and GitHub marks the deployment as failed. The service is restarted again as a best-effort rollback.

## First-time VPS setup

This only needs to be done once (or when provisioning a new server).

### 1. Bootstrap the VPS

```bash
# Run from your local machine
ssh root@187.127.180.98 'bash -s' < scripts/setup_vps.sh
```

This will:
- Clone the repo to `/opt/mesiri`
- Create a Python venv at `/opt/mesiri/.venv`
- Install Python dependencies
- Install and enable the `mesiri` systemd service
- Create `/var/www/mesiriadmin/` for the frontend

### 2. Create the production `.env`

```bash
ssh root@187.127.180.98
cp /opt/mesiri/.env.example /opt/mesiri/.env
nano /opt/mesiri/.env
```

Fill in:
- `MESIRI_POSTGRES__HOST`, `MESIRI_POSTGRES__PASSWORD`, etc.
- `MESIRI_REDIS__HOST`
- WhatsApp credentials
- AI provider keys (Sarvam, Gemini)
- `MESIRI_ENVIRONMENT=production`

Then start the service:
```bash
systemctl start mesiri
journalctl -u mesiri -f   # watch logs
```

### 3. Create a deploy SSH key pair

```bash
# On your local machine (or on the VPS — either works)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions-deploy" -f ~/.ssh/github_deploy -N ""
```

Add the **public key** to the VPS:
```bash
ssh root@187.127.180.98 "echo '$(cat ~/.ssh/github_deploy.pub)' >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

### 4. Add GitHub Secrets

Go to: **Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**

| Secret name | Value |
|---|---|
| `VPS_SSH_KEY` | Contents of `~/.ssh/github_deploy` (the private key) |
| `VPS_HOST` | `187.127.180.98` |
| `VPS_USER` | `root` |

### 5. Create a GitHub Environment (optional but recommended)

Go to: **Repo → Settings → Environments → New environment**

Name it `production`. You can add required reviewers or deployment protection rules here so pushes to main require approval before deploying.

## Direct VPS access (manual debugging / one-off fixes)

You don't need to wait for CI to inspect or fix things on the box directly — the same deploy key GitHub Actions uses (`VPS_SSH_KEY` secret) works for a normal SSH session if you have a local copy of the private key.

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<your-copy-of-the-deploy-key> root@187.127.180.98
```

- **Host**: `187.127.180.98` (same as the `VPS_HOST` secret)
- **User**: `root`
- **Key**: the same keypair from [First-time VPS setup](#first-time-vps-setup) step 3 (`~/.ssh/github_deploy` there). If you don't have a local copy, get the private key from wherever the team stores secrets, or generate a new keypair and append its public half to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the VPS (you'll need an existing session to do that once).
- **Gotcha**: if `ssh -i` fails with `Load key "...": invalid format`, the key file has picked up CRLF line endings (common after copy-pasting on Windows) — re-save it with LF-only line endings, or run it through `tr -d '\r'` into a fresh file, before retrying.

Once connected you have full root access — see [Useful commands on the VPS](#useful-commands-on-the-vps) below, and [Directory layout](#directory-layout-on-the-vps) for where things live.

### Adding/editing an nginx site directly

Both `mercon.conf` (mesiri.mercon.tech) and `mercon_web.conf` (mesiriweb.mercon.tech) are tracked in the repo root as a record of what's live, but nginx reads from `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` on the VPS — editing the repo copy does **not** change production by itself. To add or change a site:

```bash
scp -i ~/.ssh/<key> ./mercon_web.conf root@187.127.180.98:/etc/nginx/sites-available/mesiriweb.mercon.tech.conf
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<key> root@187.127.180.98 \
  "ln -sf /etc/nginx/sites-available/mesiriweb.mercon.tech.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/mesiriweb.mercon.tech.conf && nginx -t && systemctl reload nginx"
```

For a new subdomain, also point a DNS A record at `187.127.180.98` first (propagation is usually near-instant), and provision TLS once DNS resolves:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<key> root@187.127.180.98 \
  "certbot --nginx -d <subdomain>.mercon.tech --non-interactive --agree-tos -m <your-email> --redirect"
```

Certbot rewrites the nginx config in place to add the `listen 443 ssl` block and the HTTP→HTTPS redirect. After running it, pull the updated config back into the repo so `mercon.conf`/`mercon_web.conf` stays in sync with what's actually live:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<key> root@187.127.180.98 "cat /etc/nginx/sites-available/<subdomain>.mercon.tech.conf" > mercon_web.conf
```

---

## Checking deploy / CI status from the terminal

Use the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) instead of switching to the browser — run from the repo root, it infers the repo from the git remote.

```bash
# List recent workflow runs on main (name, status, conclusion, commit, duration)
gh run list --branch main --limit 10

# Watch a run live
gh run watch <run-id>

# Full logs for a specific run
gh run view <run-id> --log

# Only the failed step's logs — the fastest way to diagnose a red run
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed

# Re-run a failed workflow without a new commit (useful for transient
# network blips — e.g. the deploy step failing to reach the VPS)
gh run rerun <run-id>

# Manually trigger a deploy without pushing a commit
gh workflow run "Deploy to Production" --ref main
```

If `Deploy to Production` fails specifically at the **Configure SSH** step (`ssh-keyscan` exits non-zero) while `CI` and `CI (Python runtime)` both pass, that's a connectivity problem between GitHub's runners and the VPS, not a code problem — check `journalctl`/`/var/log/auth.log` on the VPS for whether the connection attempt even arrived (if it didn't, it's a network-level block upstream of the box, e.g. a provider firewall/DDoS filter, not anything `sshd`-side); a `gh run rerun` is often enough if it was transient.

## Migrations

Migrations use **Alembic**. The migration chain lives in `backend/migrations/versions/`.

### Create a new migration

```bash
# Auto-generate from SQLAlchemy model changes
make migrate-generate MSG="add_foo_table"

# Or write it by hand in backend/migrations/versions/
```

### Apply migrations locally

```bash
make migrate
```

### Apply migrations in production (done automatically by CD)

```bash
ssh root@187.127.180.98
cd /opt/mesiri/backend
PYTHONPATH=/opt/mesiri/shared/contracts/src:/opt/mesiri/platform/ai/src:/opt/mesiri/backend/src:/opt/mesiri/apps/whatsapp-assistant/src \
  /opt/mesiri/.venv/bin/alembic upgrade head
```

### Roll back one migration

```bash
ssh root@187.127.180.98
cd /opt/mesiri/backend
PYTHONPATH=... /opt/mesiri/.venv/bin/alembic downgrade -1
```

---

## Manual emergency deploy

If you need to deploy without waiting for CI:

```bash
# Trigger the workflow manually from the GitHub Actions UI:
# Actions → Deploy to Production → Run workflow → main
```

Or directly on the VPS (backend only — this does not rebuild/redeploy either frontend, see below for that):

```bash
ssh root@187.127.180.98
cd /opt/mesiri
git pull origin main
.venv/bin/uv pip install -e ".[infra,providers,workflow]" --quiet
cd backend && PYTHONPATH=... .venv/bin/alembic upgrade head && cd ..
systemctl restart mesiri
```

To manually deploy a frontend without CI, build it locally and `rsync` the `dist/` folder up:

```bash
# From the repo root, for either app
pnpm --filter @mesiri/dashboard build      # or: pnpm --filter control-panel build
rsync -avz --delete apps/dashboard/dist/ root@187.127.180.98:/var/www/mesiriweb/
ssh root@187.127.180.98 "chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/mesiriweb/"
```

---

## Useful commands on the VPS

```bash
# Live backend logs
journalctl -u mesiri -f

# Service status
systemctl status mesiri

# Restart backend
systemctl restart mesiri

# Check which commit is deployed
git -C /opt/mesiri log -1 --oneline

# Current migration revision
cd /opt/mesiri/backend && PYTHONPATH=... .venv/bin/alembic current
```
