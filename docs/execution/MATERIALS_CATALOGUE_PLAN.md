# Materials Catalogue, Units-of-Measure & Movement Ledger — Plan

**Status:** Done — backend, WhatsApp assistant, Alembic migrations (`0290`/`0300`/`0310`), canonical movement ledger, resolution gates, and dashboard catalogue UI all landed.

*Verification note (2026-07-30):* the backend material suites were re-run and pass — **45 passed** (`tests/unit/test_material_*.py` + `tests/contract/test_materials_api_contract.py`), matching the figure originally claimed here. The assistant-side figure (46) could **not** be re-verified from this machine: `apps/whatsapp-assistant`'s venv has no `mesiri` package installed, so its suite fails at conftest import rather than running. Treat the assistant number as reported-but-unconfirmed until someone runs it in a properly provisioned environment. The dashboard catalogue UI lives in `catalogue-view.tsx` — the `manage-catalogue-dialog.tsx` named in `AGENTS.md`'s Module Placement Log does not exist and that row should be corrected.
**Author:** Ilan (shared with Alan 2026-07-12).
**Supersedes:** the stopgap unit-alias handling landed in commit `1ad7977` (`_UNIT_ALIASES` dicts in `canonicalization/builder.py` and `runtime/inventory_query.py`) — those are explicitly meant to be retired once this lands, not kept alongside it. Check whether commit `1ad7977`'s two dicts have actually been removed yet as part of cleanup.

Before extending this further (e.g. the unit-conversion question below), re-read this in full and confirm open decisions with the user first (per `AGENTS.md`'s "Explain Before Executing" and "Module Placement Log" rules).

## Context

Material inflow/outflow entries accept free-text `material_name`/`unit` today. `materials_catalog` exists but is silently auto-populated (`get_or_create_by_name`), so near-duplicate rows accumulate. There is no units-of-measure table. Stock is computed ad hoc as `SUM(receipts) − SUM(usage)` grouped by raw `(material_name, unit)` strings, with no audit trail of individual stock-affecting events.

Goal: make the materials catalogue and a fixed units-of-measure list the only valid source of truth for what can be entered, across all three write paths (dashboard, WhatsApp, direct API). Unmatched/ambiguous input is rejected and the system asks a clarifying question (reusing the WhatsApp project-picker pattern), never silently guesses or auto-creates. Introduce an immutable `material_movements` ledger as the single source of stock truth, so future procurement/issue workflows can post into the same ledger without redesigning stock.

Ship as **one coordinated release** across backend, WhatsApp assistant, and dashboard — not split across separate deploys.

## Verified current state (as of 2026-07-12)

- Alembic head: `0280`. New migrations start at `0290`.
- Idempotency: only the WhatsApp CQRS path has it (`idempotency_keys` table, claim via `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`). The REST path (`domains/materials/router.py`) has none.
- No unit-of-work abstraction anywhere. CQRS path opens one transaction in `application/materials/handlers.py`. REST path relies on an ambient per-request connection.
- Only two write paths create `material_receipts`/`material_usage` rows: `router.py` and `material_execution.py`.
- `material_receipts`/`material_usage` already behave as an append-only ledger (migration `0270` adds reversal-by-offsetting-row, never UPDATE/DELETE) — `material_movements` should follow the same convention. **Re-read `0270`'s exact reversal mechanics (sign flip vs opposite type) before implementing movement reversal.**
- Dashboard nav already has a top-level `Materials` entry (`/materials`); no catalogue-admin view exists yet.

## Design summary

1. **Three-table split**: `materials_catalog`/`material_receipts`/`material_usage` stay as operational records (one row per reported event). `material_movements` becomes the only source of stock truth — insert-only, corrections via `reversal_of_movement_id` offsetting rows, never UPDATE/DELETE.
2. **`material_movements` schema** (new): `id`, `organization_id`, `project_id`/`site_id` (nullable, mirror current nullability), `material_id` (NOT NULL), `unit_id` (NOT NULL), `movement_type` (`RECEIPT`|`ISSUE`, Python constant tuple not a DB CHECK — matches existing convention), `quantity` (always positive), `occurred_at`, `source_type`/`source_id` (polymorphic pointer, no FK), `recorded_by_user_id`, `reversal_of_movement_id`, `idempotency_key`, `created_at`. No procurement-specific columns.
3. **Canonical posting function**: `backend/src/mesiri/domains/materials/posting.py: post_material_movement(conn, ...)`. Both write paths (REST + CQRS) call it on the same connection already used for the receipt/usage insert, so both inserts are atomic by construction.
4. **Idempotency**: CQRS path already protected. REST path gets a `UNIQUE(source_type, source_id, movement_type)` constraint as the minimum viable guard (V1) — full request-level idempotency for REST is an accepted, explicitly out-of-scope gap for now.
5. **DB-backed units + aliases** (new `units_of_measure` + `unit_aliases` tables): seed from the canonical set already in `1ad7977`'s `_UNIT_ALIASES` (`bags`, `kg`, `tons`, `litres`, `pieces`, `rolls`, `boxes`) plus any additional codes confirmed with the user. No unit *conversion* in the original version of this plan — aliases only resolve spelling variants of the same unit.
6. **One Stock Unit per material (V1)**: `materials_catalog.default_unit_id` becomes NOT NULL and is the material's enforced unit. Mismatches are rejected/clarified, not silently coerced. Changing it after movements exist is blocked at the application layer. No multi-unit-per-material, no conversion — deferred.
7. **WhatsApp resolution flow**: material resolution (0 matches → picker, >1 matches → picker over ambiguous set, e.g. "cement" → OPC vs PPC) → unit validation against the resolved material's Stock Unit (alias-normalize, mismatch → single accept/cancel clarifying question naming the correct unit, never a global unit picker) → existing project gate → confirmation (low-stock warning preserved) → execution (same canonical `post_material_movement`).
8. **Dashboard**: no new top-level nav item — a `Manage Catalogue` action inside the existing `/materials` page, gated to ADMIN role, following the `Projects.tsx`/`project-dialogs.tsx` dialog pattern. Entry-form material field becomes a searchable combobox (new `components/ui/combobox.tsx`, `cmdk` + Radix `Popover`); unit field becomes the existing `Select` wrapper.
9. **Procurement boundary**: documented only (comments on `material_movements`, no code) — future `Goods Receipt`/`Material Issue Document` sources post into the same ledger via the same function with a new `source_type`, no schema change. Materials/Stock must never depend on Procurement.

### Migration order

A (`0290`, units+aliases) → B (`0300`, movements ledger + historical backfill) → C (manual stock-parity verification against staging, not an automatic migration gate) → D (coordinated application changes, all three repos together) → E (cutover: stock queries switch to reading `material_movements`) → F (cleanup: remove the two hardcoded `_UNIT_ALIASES` dicts, the read-time merge, `get_or_create_by_name`) → G (`0310`, enforce NOT NULL + unique constraints).

### Open decisions requiring explicit confirmation before implementation

- `0270`'s exact reversal semantics — must be re-read and confirmed, this plan currently assumes without verifying.
- Full REST-path idempotency (client-supplied key) — deferred by default; confirm if the user wants it in V1 instead.
- Stock-parity verification: manual triage vs. automatic hard-abort — plan recommends manual (avoid blocking deploys on pre-existing bad data); confirm tolerance is acceptable.
- Exact final seed list for `units_of_measure` beyond `bags`/`kg`/`tons`/`litres`/`pieces`/`rolls`/`boxes` (candidates: `cum`, `mt`, `nos`, `sqft`).
- **Unit conversion — owned by Ilan, do not implement from this side.** Raised 2026-07-12: should the units system convert between units of the same physical dimension (e.g. feet ↔ centimetres), storing as reported but answering "how many feet is that?" on demand. Ilan has confirmed he will implement this himself, since it extends `units_of_measure` (already live via `0290`) and he owns that table. Recommendation, for whoever implements it: add a `dimension` (length/weight/volume/count) and `to_base_factor` column, restricted to same-dimension conversions with a fixed, unambiguous ratio. Do **not** extend this to cross-dimension, material-specific conversions (e.g. "50 kg of cement = how many bags") without an explicit, admin-configured, material-specific factor — that depends on bag weight, which varies, and is a materially riskier problem than pure unit conversion. Nothing to do here until Ilan lands it — if picking this up later, check `units_of_measure`'s current schema first rather than assuming this recommendation is still unimplemented.

## Verification (once implemented)

- Backend: `pytest backend/tests/unit/test_material_*.py backend/tests/contract/test_materials_api_contract.py` plus new movement-ledger/idempotency/parity tests; run migrations against a scratch DB seeded with messy historic data to confirm abort-on-unmapped behavior.
- WhatsApp: existing `inbound_journey`/`canonicalization` suite plus new gate-sequencing and stock-unit-mismatch tests; manually drive a staging conversation against a catalogue with OPC + PPC cement to confirm the picker fires correctly.
- Dashboard: verify `Manage Catalogue` only shows for ADMIN, exercise create/edit including the Stock Unit lock-after-movements behavior, confirm entry forms reject free text.
