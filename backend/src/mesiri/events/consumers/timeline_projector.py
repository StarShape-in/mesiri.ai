"""Projects confirmed outbox_events into timeline_entries (the Timeline read model).

Per architecture: downstream systems (dashboard/timeline UI) read only
timeline_entries, never business tables. This module is the single writer
of that projection — a plain idempotent batch function, not a persistent
worker (see mesiri.application.materials.recovery for the same convention:
"invocable manually or via a cron entry — not a background worker service").

Concurrency safety: uses `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` on the
outbox_events batch select. Two concurrent invocations (e.g. overlapping
cron runs) each lock a disjoint set of unpublished rows and skip rows the
other already holds, rather than blocking or double-projecting. This is
preferred over an ON-CONFLICT claim table (as used by
material_execution.py's idempotency_keys) because here the "claim" and the
"do the work" are the same short transaction, not a claim-now /
complete-later split — SKIP LOCKED is the standard Postgres primitive for
exactly this "queue drain" shape, and outbox_events' own
ix_outbox_events_unpublished partial index was built for it.

Crash safety: published_at is only set after the timeline_entries insert
succeeds, in the same transaction. If the process dies mid-batch, the
transaction rolls back entirely — no row is left half-projected, and
everything in that batch is retried (safely, since it was never marked
published) on the next invocation.
