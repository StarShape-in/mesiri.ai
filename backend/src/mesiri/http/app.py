"""FastAPI application factory exposing liveness and readiness (M1).

Endpoints:
    GET /health/live   -> the process is running (never touches dependencies)
    GET /health/ready  -> can the process reach Postgres, Redis, object storage

A middleware binds the correlation id for every request: it honours an inbound
``X-Correlation-ID`` header (so a journey started upstream stays traceable) or
mints one, and echoes it back. Health responses carry no credentials — only
user-safe dependency states.

Serve with:  uvicorn --factory mesiri.http.app:create_app
