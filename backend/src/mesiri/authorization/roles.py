"""The single definition of "who can reach every project in the org".

This rule decides which project and site a WhatsApp report is filed against,
what the dashboard lets someone read and write, and what the control panel
reports about their access. It was previously written out independently in
five places:

  - apps/whatsapp-assistant/src/backend/postgres/actor.py   (WhatsApp)
  - apps/whatsapp-assistant/src/context/identity_projection.py (projection)
  - apps/whatsapp-assistant/src/projects/router.py          (dashboard API)
  - apps/whatsapp-assistant/src/admin/router.py             (control panel)
  - backend/src/mesiri/authorization/service.py             (dashboard authz)

Four applied it correctly; the control panel one omitted the role half and
reported an ADMIN with the default policy as "No projects assigned" while
both other surfaces gave that same person every project. Under-reporting
privilege is the dangerous direction: an operator auditing permissions sees
"no access" and moves on.

Keeping the rule in one importable place is the point of this module -- a
future change to who counts as org-wide has exactly one edit site, and
tests/unit/test_org_wide_access_rule.py fails if a copy reappears.
