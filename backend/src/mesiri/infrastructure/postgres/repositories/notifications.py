"""PostgreSQL repository for notifications (#9 Notifications).

The only file permitted to hold SQL for the notifications table. Two kinds
of method: FINDERS (one per rule_key, returning candidates to notify about)
and the generic QUEUE operations (claim/list/mark) every rule_key shares.

Scope, stated plainly: only ONE finder is implemented in this pass --
find_stuck_confirmations. It is the one check where the recipient is
unambiguous: workflow_instances already carries the user_id whose own
confirmation is stuck, no separate "who manages this site" lookup needed.
The other three checks named in the original brief (missing_dpr,
no_updates_today, unresolved_issue) need exactly that lookup -- this
codebase has no defined concept yet of who is responsible for a site
(project membership exists, but "the person to nudge about site X" is a
product decision, not a query this repository should guess at). Adding
those finders is a mechanical follow-up once that's decided; the queue
mechanics below (claim/list/mark) are already generic enough to support
them without changes.
