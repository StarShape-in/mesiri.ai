"""PostgreSQL implementation of mesiri.application.progress.repository.ProgressExecutionRepository.

The only file permitted to hold SQL for activities/activity_quantities/
progress_updates execution (capability-boundary convention, mirrors
material_execution.py and labour_execution.py). Every method takes an
externally-supplied connection — the Application Handler opens the one
transaction; this repository never commits.

Emits generic `outbox_events` rows for both Activity creation and Progress
Update append, the same mechanism every other operational module already
uses. **Not yet registered** in
`mesiri.events.consumers.timeline_projector.AGGREGATE_TABLES` — that
registration is Phase 6.0 of docs/execution/DAILY_REPORTING_PLAN.md, tracked
there alongside the pre-existing Labour/Finance projection gaps. Note for
whoever does that registration: `activities` uses `activity_date` /
`started_at` rather than the `occurred_date` / `occurred_time` names
`AGGREGATE_TABLES`'s other entries use — either alias those columns in the
registration or extend the projector to accept a column-name mapping per
aggregate type, whichever is less invasive at the time.
