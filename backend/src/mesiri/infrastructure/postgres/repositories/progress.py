"""Read access for activities, progress updates, and site issues -- plus the
dashboard-direct corrections/undo ADR-D14/D15 define.

Companion to progress_execution.py, which owns the *write* path a WhatsApp
confirmation takes for a brand-new Activity/Progress Update. This file is
everything else: reads, Site Issues (dashboard-direct, no confirm step --
see create_issue/acknowledge_issue etc. above), and now corrections/undo of
an already-recorded Activity or Progress Update, per
docs/execution/DAILY_REPORTING_PLAN.md's ADR-D14/D15:

  ADR-D14 (correction) -- a wrong Activity-header field (work_type,
  location_id, contractor, narrative, activity_date) is corrected by a
  direct UPDATE + an activity_corrections audit row
  (`correct_activity_fields`). A wrong Progress Update quantity is
  corrected by *appending* a new row that supersedes the old one -- the old
  row is never edited or deleted (`correct_progress_update`); Progress
  Updates stay append-only (P1) even under correction.

  ADR-D15 (undo) -- removing an Activity/Progress Update entirely
  (`void_activity`/`void_progress_update`) is a soft delete
  (`deleted_at`), and -- unlike correction -- is refused outright once the
  value has been frozen into an APPROVED/PUBLISHED daily_report_versions
  row (P7). Correction is allowed past that point and produces a DPR
  revision instead (see `_revise_dpr_if_frozen`); undo is not, because
  there is no way to "revise a report to remove something" without also
  deciding what replaces it -- that's a correction, not an undo.
