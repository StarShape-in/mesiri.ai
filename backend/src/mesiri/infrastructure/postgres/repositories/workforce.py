"""Read/write access for the workforce register and attendance reports.

Companion to labour_execution.py, which owns the *write* path a WhatsApp
confirmation takes (persist_success/persist_rejection against the same four
tables). This file is the dashboard-facing read side, plus the register's
own CRUD (workforce_workers is the one table here that a dashboard writes to
directly, since promoting/editing a worker is not a WhatsApp-confirmed
workflow the way attendance is).

Mirrors materials.py's PostgresMaterialReadRepository for shape: plain
sqlalchemy Core tables, no ORM, every method takes an externally-supplied
connection and never commits.
