"""PostgreSQL repository for Daily Progress Reports (DPR).

Handles read/write operations for daily_reports, daily_report_versions, and
daily_report_sources (docs/execution/DAILY_REPORTING_PLAN.md ADR-D6/D9).

`assemble_site_report_payload` + `create_version` are the real generation
path (#16 Daily Report Generation): they compose a version's `payload`
JSONB from the activities/site_issues/progress_attachments actually
recorded for one site+date, rather than trusting a caller-supplied payload.
The older `create_report`/`get_report`/`list_reports` methods remain for the
existing dashboard's manual-entry form (POST /dpr/daily-reports with a
hand-typed payload) -- a different, still-valid path for a report with no
WhatsApp activity behind it, not something this generation path replaces.

Scope, stated plainly (matches this session's other narrowing decisions):
`assemble_site_report_payload` composes activities + site_issues +
evidence *counts* + labour attendance + material movements for one
SITE-level report -- a cross-module read, deliberately: a report without
manpower and material isn't one a client accepts, and both exist today
(unlike finance, which genuinely can't participate yet -- expenses never
emit to `outbox_events`, so there is no event trail this read could join
against; equipment has no backend at all, no table, no read/write path).
PROJECT-level composition from approved SITE versions (ADR-D9/P8,
`daily_report_sources`) is not built here either -- a natural next step,
not silently done halfway.
