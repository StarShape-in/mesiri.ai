"""Pure payload shaping for a SITE-level DPR (#16 Daily Report Generation).

Takes raw DB rows (already fetched by infrastructure/postgres/repositories/
dpr.py) and shapes them into the plain JSON-safe dict stored as
`daily_report_versions.payload` and consumed by the assistant-side PDF
renderer (channel/dpr_document/). No I/O here -- the split exists so this
shaping is unit-testable without a live database, same reasoning as
runtime/labour_query_service.py's `_summarize`.

`labour_lines`/`material_movement_rows` are optional (default to empty) so
existing callers/tests built before this data existed keep working -- a
report with nothing recorded in either module still shapes a valid, honest
zeroed section rather than omitting the key.
