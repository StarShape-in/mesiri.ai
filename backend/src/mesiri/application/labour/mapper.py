"""Maps a confirmed workflow action into a typed Labour Application Command (M8).

Shape-mapping only — no business validation here (that's
domains/workforce/validation.py, run separately by the Handler). Mirrors
application/materials/mapper.py: occurred_date is defaulted to today because
nothing upstream (CanonicalEvent/DraftAction) ever carries a stated date;
occurred_date_source records that this is an inferred value, not a
user-reported one.

Each line arrives from workflows/labour_update/nodes.py's build_draft as a
plain dict (draft.fields is JSON-shaped, not typed) — this is the one place
that turns those dicts back into LabourAttendanceLine, matching the shape
the domain and the database both expect.
