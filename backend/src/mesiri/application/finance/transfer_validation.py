"""Pure structural validation for TransferMoneyCommand — no DB, no I/O.

Account existence/active-status is a DB-backed check and belongs to
transfer_resolution.py's PostgresTransferAccountResolver, mirroring the
structural-vs-DB-backed split used everywhere else in this codebase (see
application/expenses/validation.py's docstring).

Role enforcement lives here rather than earlier in the WhatsApp pipeline: a
disallowed role can still complete slot-fill, but the transfer is rejected
before any money moves, consistent with every other business rule in this
codebase being enforced in the Domain/Application layer, not the
interaction layer.
