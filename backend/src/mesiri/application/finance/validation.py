"""Pure structural validation for ManageMoneyAccountCommand — no DB, no I/O.

Duplicate-name (create) / account-not-found (rename, deactivate) checks are
deliberately not here — those need a DB round trip and belong to
resolution.py's PostgresAccountLookupResolver, mirroring
application/expenses/validation.py's split between structural and
DB-backed checks.

Role enforcement lives here too, mirroring transfer_validation.py's
docstring reasoning exactly: this is defense-in-depth, not the only gate --
runtime/inbound_journey.py already refuses to even start the workflow for a
disallowed role (this "should not even be an option" for the WhatsApp UX,
per the explicit ask that reopened this), and
runtime/account_admin_journey.py's deterministic fast path does the same.
This check exists in case either of those is ever bypassed or a future
caller reaches this Command directly.
