"""ReverseTransaction Application Command.

Local to backend (not a shared mesiri_contracts contract), mirrors
application/finance/transfer_commands.py's reasoning. `expense_id`/
`money_transaction_id` are already real UUIDs by the time this command
exists -- runtime/inbound_journey.py's seeding step resolves "the most
recent expense/transfer" into a concrete id before the draft is ever built
(see workflows/reverse/nodes.py), mirroring how transfer's account ids are
resolved before its draft.

`created_by_role` travels through the draft the same way transfer's does
(seeded in runtime/inbound_journey.py, carried in draft.fields) so the
who-may-reverse rule can be enforced in reverse_validation.py.
