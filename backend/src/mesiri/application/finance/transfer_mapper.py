"""Maps a confirmed workflow action into a TransferMoneyCommand.

Shape-mapping only — no business validation here (that's
transfer_validation.py, run separately by the Handler). Mirrors
application/expenses/mapper.py. `occurred_date` is defaulted to today
because nothing upstream (CanonicalEvent/DraftAction) ever carries a stated
date, same reasoning as application/expenses/mapper.py.
