"""Pure structural validation for ReverseTransactionCommand — no DB, no I/O.

Existence/already-reversed checks are DB-backed and belong to
reverse_resolution.py's PostgresReverseTargetResolver, mirroring the
structural-vs-DB-backed split used everywhere else in this codebase (see
application/expenses/validation.py's docstring).

Role enforcement lives here rather than earlier in the WhatsApp pipeline,
same reasoning as transfer_validation.py: a disallowed role can still reach
this point, but the reversal is rejected before anything is undone. The
ADMIN/FINANCE gate below is specifically a *money-movement* control
(docs/execution/FINANCE_MODULE_PLAN.md's permission table) and does not
apply to `target_kind == "activity"` -- ADR-D15 governs that case instead:
undo is authorized by the same-session scoping in runtime/
reversal_query.py's find_latest_activity (only the reporter's own
just-created Activity is ever resolved), not by role.
