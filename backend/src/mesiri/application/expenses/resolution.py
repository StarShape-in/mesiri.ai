"""Resolve a RecordExpenseCommand's category_text against expense_categories.

Defense-in-depth guard, mirrors application/materials/resolution.py, with
one deliberate asymmetry between the two entry points:

- REST's `category_id` is a client-chosen, already-real id (the client
  fetched it from the categories list) — if it doesn't resolve, that's a
  genuine integrity error worth surfacing as a rejection.
- WhatsApp's `category_text` is an AI guess (extraction is nudged toward the
  org's real category names — see understanding/pipeline.py's
  `expense_categories` param — but is not guaranteed to comply exactly).
  Rejecting the whole expense over an AI naming mismatch would just
  reproduce the "category_id or category_text is required"-style rejection
  bug this module was built to avoid. So an unmatched or absent
  category_text both fall back to the default "Uncategorized" category
  (get_or_create_default) instead of rejecting — only a REST category_id
  lookup failure is a hard rejection.

`ExpenseCategoryResolver` is an injectable port so Handler unit tests can
supply a fake instead of hitting Postgres — see application/expenses/fakes.py.
