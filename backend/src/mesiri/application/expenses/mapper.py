"""Maps a confirmed workflow action into a RecordExpenseCommand (M8-style).

Shape-mapping only — no business validation here (that's validation.py, run
separately by the Handler).

occurred_date is decided upstream, in canonicalization
(canonicalization/occurred_date.py) — the only point holding both what the
message said and the sender's timezone. Backported from Labour (STA-166):
until this changed, a stated "yesterday" was silently overwritten with
today, and "today" meant the server's UTC today rather than the site's. The
`date.today()` fallback below exists only so a draft persisted before this
shipped stays confirmable.

Unlike Material, RecordExpenseCommand carries no occurred_date_source field
at all -- there is no `expenses` table column for it (checked before adding
one; none exists) and the "(assumed today)" wording only ever needs to reach
the confirmation preview, which reads `occurred_date_source` straight off
`draft.fields` before this mapper ever runs. Adding an unused column would
be schema change for no reader.
