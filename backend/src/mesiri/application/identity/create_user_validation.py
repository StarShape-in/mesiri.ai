"""Pure structural validation for CreateUserCommand — no DB, no I/O.

The number-already-registered check happens at persist time (a DB round
trip, mirroring create_site_validation.py's docstring reasoning) -- this
file only rejects a command that's structurally incomplete before it ever
reaches the repository.

Role enforcement lives here too, mirroring add_member_validation.py's
docstring reasoning exactly: this is defense-in-depth, not the only gate --
runtime/inbound_journey.py already refuses to even start the workflow for a
disallowed role.
