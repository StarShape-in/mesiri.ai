"""Per-project auto-DPR: the backend half of making `projects.
auto_generate_dpr` actually do something.

Until this module existed, `auto_generate_dpr`/`reporting_cutoff_time`/
`reporting_timezone` (migration 0260) were dashboard-editable but never
read anywhere -- toggling "auto-generate DPR" on a project changed nothing.
This is the DB-facing half (finding due projects, generating today's DPR
for one); the scheduler-facing half (recipients, notification queuing,
`is_due` timing, the tick loop itself) lives on the assistant side at
runtime/project_auto_dpr.py, same capability-boundary split
run_dpr_generation.py's own module docstring describes (backend assembles
+ writes daily_reports rows; the assistant renders/sends).

Deliberately narrower than scripts/run_dpr_generation.py's nightly sweep:
that script (still ops-cron-driven, unconnected to any per-project setting)
regenerates every org's site+project reports on ONE fixed daily schedule.
This module generates ONE project's own SITE-level drafts (for its own
active sites with today's activity) and PROJECT-level rollup, called only
when that project's own `is_due()` check (reporting_cutoff_time/timezone)
says it's time -- so a project set to 6pm IST gets its DPR at 6pm IST,
independent of whenever the ops cron happens to run.
