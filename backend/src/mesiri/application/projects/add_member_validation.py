"""Pure structural validation for AddProjectMemberCommand — no DB, no I/O.

Runs after the Handler has already tried to resolve member_name into
member_user_id (see handlers.py) -- an unresolved name is rejected there,
before this ever runs, so member_user_id being unset here would be a bug in
the Handler, not a user-facing case this needs to word nicely. The target
project's existence and any duplicate-membership check happen at persist
time (a DB round trip, mirroring create_site_validation.py's docstring
reasoning) -- this file only rejects a command that's structurally
incomplete before it ever reaches the repository.

Role enforcement lives here too, mirroring create_site_validation.py's
docstring reasoning exactly: this is defense-in-depth, not the only gate --
runtime/inbound_journey.py already refuses to even start the workflow for a
disallowed role.
