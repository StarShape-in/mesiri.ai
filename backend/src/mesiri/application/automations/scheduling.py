"""Pure "is this automation due right now?" decision -- no I/O, no DB.

Mirrors application/notifications/checks.py's reasoning exactly: the
at-most-once guarantee itself lives in the database (notifications'
UNIQUE constraint), so this only needs to answer the timing question
correctly -- getting it wrong either fires an automation twice in one day
(if `last_run_on` were ignored) or never fires it at all (if the weekday/
time comparison is wrong), and both are the kind of bug nobody notices
until a user complains their 5pm DPR never arrived.

`automations.timezone` is the row's OWN timezone (set at creation, from
the creating user's resolved context or the project's `reporting_timezone`
default) -- everything here is evaluated in that zone, never server/UTC
time, since "5pm" means 5pm where the person who asked lives.
