"""Application Handler for confirmed Material actions (M8).

Owns the orchestration order: map -> validate (pure, no transaction) -> open
the one transaction -> check idempotency -> resolve material/unit against the
catalog -> persist success or rejection. This is the only place a
transaction is opened (Requirement 7 — transaction ownership is centralized
here, not scattered across repositories).

Catalog/unit resolution needs a connection, so it runs inside the
transaction, after idempotency is checked (a replay short-circuits before
touching the catalog at all) and after the pure structural validation. It is
a defense-in-depth guard — the WhatsApp assistant's deterministic gate chain
(runtime/inbound_journey.py) should normally have already resolved
material_id/unit_id before the user ever confirms; this resolver just
refuses to persist against anything that turns out to be missing, inactive,
or the wrong Stock Unit (see application/materials/resolution.py).

FAILED is never constructed here: an unhandled exception from anything below
propagates out of this method, rolling back the transaction (workflow stays
at CONFIRMED, recoverable) — the caller (the interactions ExecutionDispatcher
adapter) is responsible for catching it and reporting ExecutionStatus.FAILED.
