"""Material execution repository port (M8).

Defines the contract for persisting a confirmed Material command's outcome
without coupling to a specific implementation (PostgreSQL, fake, etc.).
Every method takes an externally-supplied connection — the repository never
opens an engine and never commits; the Application Handler owns the one
transaction (backend capability-boundary + transaction-ownership rules).
