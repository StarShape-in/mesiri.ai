"""Maps a confirmed workflow action into a typed Material Application Command (M8).

Shape-mapping only — no business validation here (that's domains/materials/
validation.py, run separately by the Handler).

occurred_date/occurred_date_source are decided upstream, in canonicalization
(canonicalization/occurred_date.py) — that is the only point holding both
what the message said and the sender's timezone. This mapper only reads the
answer. Backported from Labour (STA-166): until this changed, a stated
"yesterday" was silently overwritten with today, and "today" meant the
server's UTC today rather than the site's -- for a site in India, any report
before 05:30 local landed on the wrong date. The `date.today()` fallback
below exists only so a draft persisted before this shipped (still sitting at
AWAITING_CONFIRMATION, never having passed through the new canonicalization
path) stays confirmable rather than failing on a field it never carried.
