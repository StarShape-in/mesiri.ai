"""Progress domain validation (Daily Reporting) — pure functions, no I/O, no SQL.

Mirrors domains/workforce/validation.py and domains/materials/validation.py:
runs in the Application Handler *before* any transaction opens, returning
violation reasons rather than raising, so the Handler can choose between
persist_success and persist_rejection without exception handling around
business rules.

This validates command *shape*, not resolution — unit-text resolution and
Activity-existence checks happen in application/progress/resolution.py,
which needs a connection and therefore runs inside the transaction.
