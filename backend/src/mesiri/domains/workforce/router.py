"""REST API for the workforce/labour module — register, attendance reads,
settings, and a WhatsApp sandbox dry-run.

Mounted at /labour so:
  GET   /labour/settings                     org-wide labour preferences
  PATCH /labour/settings                     update them
  GET   /labour/workers                      the register
  POST  /labour/workers                      add a worker directly (not via WhatsApp)
  PATCH /labour/workers/{worker_id}           edit/retire a worker
  GET   /labour/attendance                   list attendance reports
  GET   /labour/attendance/{report_id}        one report with its lines/attachments
  POST  /labour/whatsapp/sandbox/simulate    dry-run AI parse, no DB writes

Attendance itself is never written here -- that path is WhatsApp-confirmed
and owned by application/labour/* + labour_execution.py (principle P2: a
report is never persisted without an explicit confirmation). This router
only reads reports and manages the mutable register, mirroring the
read/write split materials.router.py already draws between
PostgresMaterialReadRepository and the execution repository.
