"""Recording a supplier invoice: one document, many purchases, one expense.

Everything here happens on the caller's connection, inside the caller's
transaction. A half-recorded invoice -- stock updated but no money owed, or an
expense with no purchases behind it -- is worse than a failed submission the
user can retry, so the whole thing lands or none of it does.

Ordering matters and is deliberate:

1. The invoice row, so purchases have a parent to point at.
2. Each line: a `material_receipts` row plus its ledger movement, through the
   same `post_material_movement` every other write path uses. No second stock
   mechanism, no special invoice accounting.
3. The attachment reference, if the original document was uploaded.
4. The Finance expense, via Finance's own handler.

Finance is called, never written to. `RecordExpenseHandler.handle(conn, cmd)`
takes a connection precisely so a caller can enlist it in an existing
transaction, so Materials passes its own and stores the returned id. Materials
does not know how expenses are numbered, categorised, or paid, and must not
learn -- it knows only that a purchase creates an obligation.
