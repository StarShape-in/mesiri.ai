"""Domain entities for money accounts and money transactions.

Plain dataclasses — no SQLAlchemy. Mesiri Daily is not an accounting system:
there is no chart of accounts, no journal entries, no debit/credit
terminology. An account's balance is always derived (opening_balance + sum
of its money_transactions), never stored as a mutable column.
