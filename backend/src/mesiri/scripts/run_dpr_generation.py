"""Generates/refreshes a SITE-level DPR draft for every site that logged
activity or a site issue on the target date, then a PROJECT-level roll-up
for every project with at least one active site (#16 Daily Report
Generation, ADR-D9/P8).

Invocable manually or via a cron entry -- not a persistent worker service,
same convention as run_notification_checks.py and project_timeline_events.py.
This is the BACKEND half only: it assembles the payload and writes
daily_reports/daily_report_versions rows. It never renders a PDF or sends
anything -- Playwright lives on the assistant side (ADR-D8), and the
backend must not know about Meta's Cloud API. The assistant-side render
script is runtime/render_pending_dpr_pdfs.py.

Re-running for the same site+date is safe and expected: it inserts a new
DRAFT version reflecting whatever has been logged since the last run
(P1 append-only facts, P7 freeze-on-approval -- create_version refuses to
touch an already-APPROVED/PUBLISHED report, see dpr.py). This is the
natural way an engineer's afternoon updates show up in the same day's DPR
without a separate "regenerate" trigger.

The PROJECT-level pass runs for every project with an active site,
regardless of whether every one of its sites has an approved SITE version
yet -- P8's "cutoff" model: a site that hasn't reported is recorded
NOT_REPORTED on the roll-up, not something the whole project's reporting
waits on. It also runs after ALL sites' SITE-level generation for the
date, so same-day project rollups see whatever sites did get generated in
this same run.

Recommended VPS crontab entry (ops-managed, not tracked in this repo):

        PYTHONPATH=/opt/mesiri/shared/contracts/src:/opt/mesiri/platform/ai/src:/opt/mesiri/backend/src \\
