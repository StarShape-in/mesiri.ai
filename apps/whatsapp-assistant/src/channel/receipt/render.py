"""HTML → PNG rendering for receipt cards.

Playwright is imported lazily here only -- the core test suite (and
data.py/template.py, which are pure) run without a headless browser
installed, same convention as workflows/material/graph.py's lazy langgraph
import. One headless Chromium instance is reused across renders (started on
first use, never per-message) since launching a browser per WhatsApp message
would be far too slow for a reply path.

Page pool (Phase 4 perf):
  Creating and closing a new browser page per confirmation was measured at
  300-600 ms. A pool of _PRE_WARMED_PAGES pages is kept ready; each render
  checks one out, sets its content, screenshots it, and checks it back in.
  This drops page-acquisition cost to near zero on warm paths. If a page
  errors it is closed and replaced so the pool stays full.
