"""HTML -> PDF rendering for the DPR document.

Playwright is imported lazily, same convention as channel/receipt/render.py.
Unlike ReceiptRenderer, this has no pre-warmed page pool: a receipt renders
once per confirmation (a hot reply-path), a DPR renders once per site per
day (runtime/render_pending_dpr_pdfs.py's cron drain) -- the pool's
complexity buys nothing at this frequency, so a page is opened and closed
per render instead. The browser instance itself is still long-lived (lazy
launch, reused across renders in the same process).
