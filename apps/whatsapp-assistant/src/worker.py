"""ARQ worker process: consumes jobs enqueued by runtime/queue.py.

Deployed as a second, independent systemd unit alongside the FastAPI process
(see infra/mesiri-worker.service) -- the web process only ever enqueues now
(ingress/receiver.py, when a real Redis is configured); this process is what
actually runs the WhatsApp journey (media download, understanding, context,
planner, workflow, reply).

Run locally with:  arq worker.WorkerSettings
