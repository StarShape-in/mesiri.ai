"""Backend capability boundary — what the assistant is allowed to know.

The assistant (context resolution, live-identity bridge, planner, workflows)
may depend on these types and protocols. They MUST NOT depend on:

  - table names (users, organizations, projects, sites)
  - JOIN conditions
  - SQLAlchemy models or ORM details
  - database migrations
  - raw tenant-filtering SQL

Concrete implementations live in backend/postgres/ and own all persistence
knowledge. If the backend schema changes, only those adapters change — the
assistant logic is untouched.
