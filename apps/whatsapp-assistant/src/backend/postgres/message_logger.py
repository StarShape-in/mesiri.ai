        (+`since_id` as a tiebreaker), only messages strictly after that
        point, oldest first — a proper cursor for live polling that's immune
        to new inserts shifting an OFFSET out from under the caller (this
        mode ignores `offset`/`total` — it's a different, correct UX for
        tailing). `body_preview` is a short hint only; the full body is only
        ever returned by `get_message_detail`. Unlike the write methods
        above, a query failure here is NOT swallowed — the caller (an
        authenticated API endpoint) should see a real error.

        `workflow_instance_id`/`workflow_key`/`workflow_phase` resolve
        through two paths: `im.workflow_instance_id` directly when this
        message itself started or resumed the workflow, or -- via
        `wi_origin` -- by matching `im.interaction_group_id` (the
        originating report's own correlation_id, stamped on every
        material/unit/project gate-clarification tap along the way, see
        inbound_journey.py's `_complete_resume_leg`) against
        `workflow_instances.correlation_id`. This lets an entire multi-turn
