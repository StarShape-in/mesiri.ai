"""System graph for the control panel — how the assistant reacts to messages.

Platform-admin only. Two capabilities:

1. GET ``/admin/system-graph`` — a structured, drill-down-ready map of the
   inbound pipeline. Nothing here is hand-drawn: the Mermaid diagram, the stage
   nodes, the workflow list, the required fields and the example messages are all
   generated on request from the live tables the runtime actually uses
   (understanding modality branches, ``canonicalization.mapping``, planner
   ``routing``, workflow ``registry``) plus each compiled LangGraph's own
   ``draw_mermaid()``, and the example copy from ``channel.replies``. Change any
   of those and this endpoint reflects it on the next refresh.

2. POST ``/admin/system-graph/simulate`` — run one message through the *real*
   pipeline (real AI providers) as a chosen org+user, capturing the reply instead
   of sending it to WhatsApp, and returning the full routing trace. Single-shot
   and side-effect-free: the material graph only builds a draft and asks for
   confirmation; nothing is persisted until a "YES" resume, which this harness
   never sends. See the ``dry_run`` marker in the response.
