"""Context-sync watchdog visibility for the control panel.

Platform-admin only: this reports on tenant identity projection across every
organization, so it isn't a per-tenant view.

Exists because auto-repair on its own would only move the blind spot. The
watchdog (context/reconcile_watchdog.py) repairs drift between the dashboard's
project/site assignments and what the WhatsApp assistant actually reads --
but if the watchdog itself started failing, that failure would be exactly as
invisible as the drift it was added to catch. These endpoints make each run
inspectable, and let an operator force one without shelling into the VPS to
run scripts/backfill_identity_bridge.py.
