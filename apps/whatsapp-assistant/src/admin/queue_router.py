"""Durable ingress queue visibility for the control panel (platform-admin only).

Exists so "is the ARQ worker actually consuming the Redis queue" is
answerable from the dashboard -- the same class of question sync-health/
reconcile_router.py answers for the context watchdog. Before this, the only
way to check was SSH + `journalctl -u mesiri-worker` + `redis-cli`, which is
exactly the gap that let the worker sit un-deployed and silently swallow
messages after the ARQ rollout (see infra/mesiri-worker.service and
deploy.yml's "Worker health check" step, added for the same incident).

Read-only: reads ARQ's own health-check key (see runtime/queue.py), which
the worker writes to itself every HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS and which
Redis expires automatically if the worker stops updating it -- so this
adds no polling loop and no new write path of its own.
