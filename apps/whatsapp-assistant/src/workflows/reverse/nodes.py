"""Reverse workflow nodes — pure functions, no LangGraph, no I/O, no SQL, no domain rules.

Finance Module Slice 7: "reverse my last expense"/"cancel that transfer".
No slot-filling here -- runtime/inbound_journey.py's seeding step
(`_seed_reversal_target`) already resolved "the most recent expense/transfer
of the requested kind" into a concrete `expense_id`/`money_transaction_id`
before this graph ever runs (a node must never query a repository itself,
see workflows/runtime.py's docstring), mirroring how account admin's
deterministic parser resolves everything before its own graph runs.

Unlike every other finance workflow, there is a genuine "nothing to
reverse" outcome: when the seeding step found no matching record,
`build_draft` deliberately omits `draft_action` and returns a friendly
`pending_prompt` instead -- `WorkflowDefinition.allows_completion_without_draft`
in workflows/registry.py allows `WorkflowKey.REVERSE` to complete without a
draft for exactly this case.
