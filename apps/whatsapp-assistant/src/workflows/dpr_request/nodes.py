"""Node for the dpr-request workflow (#16 Daily Report Generation).

Reads `collected_fields['dpr_status']`/`dpr_code`, seeded by the caller
(see runtime/dpr_request_query.py) before this graph runs. Mirrors
workflows/labour_query/nodes.py's shape and reasoning.

The actual PDF bytes are NEVER read here -- a node must not fetch object
storage content, only text fields (see workflows/runtime.py). The document
send itself happens as a separate step in runtime/inbound_journey.py, after
this node's pending_prompt is sent, keyed off the same 'ready' status this
node also reads.
