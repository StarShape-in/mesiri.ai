"""Expense capture workflow nodes — pure functions, no LangGraph, no I/O, no SQL, no domain rules.

Mirrors workflows/material/nodes.py. Each node takes the graph's working
state and returns the partial update LangGraph merges in. Shape-mapping
only — amount>0 and category resolution belong to the Application/Domain
layer (see backend's application/expenses/{validation.py,resolution.py}),
not here.

`resolve_account` is Finance Module Slice 1's "which account?" slot: account
candidates are seeded into `collected_fields['account_candidates']` by the
caller (a node must never query a repository itself -- see
runtime/money_account_query.py and workflows/runtime.py's docstring), and
"my own pocket" is always appended as an extra choice so paying personally
is a first-class answer, not merely an omitted account. See
docs/execution/FINANCE_MODULE_PLAN.md's Slice 1.

Every `SlotCandidate.label` in this module must stay <=24 chars: it doubles
as a WhatsApp interactive list-row title, and
runtime/inbound_journey.py::_render_reply degrades the whole question to
plain numbered text (no tappable list at all) the moment any one label in
the set is too long, rather than truncate it and risk a tapped row no
longer matching its own candidate. A too-long own-pocket/vendor-confirm
label silently broke this for every user until 2026-07-26 -- see git
history around that date.

`check_duplicate` is Finance Module Slice 8's "looks like a duplicate,
record anyway?" gate: whether a likely-duplicate confirmed expense already
exists is decided by the caller (runtime/inbound_journey.py's
`_seed_duplicate_check`, same "a node must never query a repository itself"
rule) and seeded as `collected_fields['is_potential_duplicate']`. This node
only asks the yes/no question -- reusing the same single-choice slot
machinery as resolve_account, since a genuine yes/no is just an N=2 choice --
and, uniquely among this graph's nodes, can end the whole workflow with no
draft at all when the answer is "no" (see graph.py's routing).

`resolve_vendor` is the "vendor not found, create it?" gate: whether the
extracted vendor name matches an existing active vendor is decided by the
caller (runtime/inbound_journey.py's `_seed_vendor_check`, same rule) and
seeded as `collected_fields['vendor_needs_confirmation']`. Reuses the same
yes/no slot machinery as check_duplicate. Unlike check_duplicate, "no" never
cancels the whole record -- it just drops the vendor from the draft (so
application/expenses/resolution.py resolves vendor_id=None instead of
auto-creating), matching the user's explicit request that this must never
block the expense itself. "yes" leaves the vendor field untouched, letting
the resolver's existing create-on-first-use behavior create it exactly as
before.
