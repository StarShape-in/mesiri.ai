"""Node for the labour-query workflow.

Reads `collected_fields['labour_results']`, seeded by the caller (see
runtime/labour_query_service.py) before this graph runs. Mirrors
workflows/expense_query/nodes.py's shape and reasoning.

The reply deliberately echoes attendance back the way it was reported: named
workers by name, groups as counts. That is principle P10 carried through to
the read side — a supervisor who wrote "Ravi mason, 12 helpers" should
recognise the answer at a glance rather than having to decode a total.
