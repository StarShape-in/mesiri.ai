"""Labour attendance workflow nodes — pure functions, no LangGraph, no I/O, no SQL.

Mirrors workflows/material/nodes.py for shape and workflows/expense_capture/
nodes.py for slot-filling. Each node takes the graph's working state and
returns the partial update LangGraph merges in.

**What is different here, and why.** Every other v1 workflow asks a *fixed*
number of questions: expense_capture has exactly two slots (`account_id`,
`duplicate_confirm`), each its own node with its own edge. Labour cannot work
that way — one attendance may name seven workers, of whom any number between
zero and seven are ambiguous, and the graph has no way to know which before it
runs.

So worker matching is a single **re-entrant** node that resolves as much as it
can per pass and asks about at most one line before stopping. The line it is
asking about is encoded in the slot name (``worker_match:2``), because the
graph is compiled without a checkpointer and is re-invoked from scratch on
every inbound message — `collected_fields` (persisted as WorkflowState.v1) is
the only thing that survives between passes, so the node re-derives everything
else from it. See workflows/runtime.py's `provide_input`.

Resolving everything resolvable *before* asking is what keeps this usable: a
ten-worker report with nine confident matches asks one question, not ten.
That is principle P9 (optimize for speed of recording) in practice, while P4
(never identify a worker by name alone) still decides what counts as
confident.

**Why this node calls domain code when others don't.** `match_worker` lives in
the backend's `domains/workforce/matching.py` and is imported directly here,
which no other workflow node does. The rule nodes obey is "no I/O, no SQL, no
repository access" — `match_worker` is a pure scoring function over candidates
the *caller* supplied (seeded into `collected_fields['worker_candidates']`,
see workflows/runtime.py's docstring), so it breaks none of that. The
alternative — having the runtime pre-compute match results and seed those too —
would split one loop across two layers for no gain in purity.

**Input shape.** `collected_fields['lines']` is a list of dicts, each either a
named worker or a headcount group (plan principle P10 — a site reports whichever
way it can, and one message may mix both)::

    {"worker_name": "Ravi", "trade": "mason", "headcount": 1, "daily_wage": 800}
    {"worker_name": None,   "trade": "helper", "headcount": 12, "daily_wage": 600}

Phase 6 rewrites AI extraction to produce this; until then the graph is
already correct, and with no candidates seeded every named line simply
resolves to a temporary worker without asking anything.
