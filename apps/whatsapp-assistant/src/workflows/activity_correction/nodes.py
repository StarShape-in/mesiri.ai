"""Activity Quantity Correction workflow nodes — pure functions, no LangGraph, no I/O, no SQL.

ADR-D14 (docs/execution/DAILY_REPORTING_PLAN.md): "make that 180 sqm" is a
correction, not a new measurement -- distinct from GENERAL_SITE_UPDATE's
"another 40 sqm done" (see canonicalization/mapping.py's REQUIRED_FIELDS and
platform/ai's extraction prompt for how that distinction is drawn).

No slot-filling here -- runtime/inbound_journey.py's seeding step
(`_seed_correction_target`) already resolved which progress_update_id this
correction targets before this graph ever runs (a node must never query a
repository itself, see workflows/runtime.py's docstring), same shape as
workflows/reverse/nodes.py's target resolution. Unlike Reverse, there is no
picker here: correction is deliberately scoped to the single Activity this
conversation just touched (same-session only, mirroring undo/ADR-D15), so
there is never more than one candidate to disambiguate.
