"""Activity Creation & Continuation workflow nodes — pure functions, no LangGraph, no I/O, no SQL.

Merges what used to be two separate workflows (site_update's "always create
a new Activity" and activity_continuation's "always append to whichever
activity_id the caller was handed") into one, per docs/execution/
ACTIVITY_RESOLUTION_AND_CORRECTION_PLAN.md. The reason: deciding
create-vs-continue purely from the extracted `update_kind` word, before any
open-activity lookup, produced two real bugs --

  F1 (wrong target): "finished plastering" appended to whichever open
  activity was most recently touched, even if it was blockwork.

  F2 (dead end): a continuation message with nothing open told the user to
  redescribe their report from scratch instead of just creating one.

`resolve_target` is the fix: it scores every open activity
(runtime/inbound_journey.py's `_seed_open_activity` seeds the candidate
list, same "a node must never query a repository itself" rule every other
resolution gate in this repo follows) against this message's own
`work_type`, via workflows/site_update/matching.py, and only asks when
there is genuine ambiguity. `build_draft` then branches on whether that
resolution left `activity_id` set.

Field names read here (`work_type`, `quantities`, `narrative`,
`location_id`, `work_package_id`, `contractor`, `activity_date`,
`activity_id`, `update_kind`, `quantity`, `unit`) are exactly what
application/progress/mapper.py's `build_create_activity_command` /
`build_add_progress_update_command` read out of
`confirmed.draft_action.fields` -- this is the one place upstream of that
mapper that decides the field names, so a rename on either side must change
both.
