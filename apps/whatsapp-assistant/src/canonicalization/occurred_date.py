"""Work out which day a report is about.

Every operational module needs this and none of them had it. Material,
Expense and Labour each stamped ``date.today()`` at the moment of saving and
recorded ``occurred_date_source="inferred_at_confirmation"`` to admit the
guess — but nothing ever showed the guess to the user, and nothing ever used
a date the user actually stated.

**Why this lives in canonicalization rather than in each module's mapper.**
The mapper runs at confirmation time and holds only the command being built:
it knows neither what the message said nor where the sender is. Those are
exactly the two things needed to date a report correctly, and both are in
hand here — the extracted fields, and the resolved context's timezone. The
old placement is the direct cause of both bugs below; moving the decision to
where the information already exists fixes them at the root rather than
patching each module.

Two failures this closes:

1. **A stated date was ignored.** "yesterday 12 masons worked" was recorded
   as today. Attendance is append-only, so that cannot be edited afterwards —
   only superseded — which makes getting it right at capture the only cheap
   moment. (The extraction prompt has asked for ``occurred_on`` on expenses
   for some time; nothing ever read it.)

2. **"Today" meant the server's today.** ``date.today()`` uses the host
   clock, which runs UTC. For a site in India (UTC+5:30) every report between
   midnight and 05:30 local was filed under the previous day. Early starts
   are normal on a construction site, so this is a real window, not a
   theoretical one.

Deliberately **not** a question. Principle P9: a prompt on every single
report costs far more than a visible assumption the user can see and correct
at confirmation. This module's job is to make the date honest and legible,
never to interrogate.

Built module-agnostic on purpose. Labour uses it today; Material and Expense
can adopt it by calling `resolve_occurred_date` and reading the two fields it
sets, with no change to their own logic.
