"""The plan preview (docs/execution/COMPOSITE_REQUEST_PLAN_LAYER.md §8, P3).

One numbered line per step, before anything runs -- the safety net a
composite request needs that a single-workflow message doesn't: five wrong
records are a much bigger mistake than one, and a bad decomposition or a
wrong entity-link is only ever caught here, before the first write. Nothing
in this module executes anything or touches PlanStore; it only describes a
Plan that has already been built (by planning/decomposition.py or any future
producer) and not yet started.

Pure -- no I/O, no provider calls. describe_step's per-step phrasing is
bespoke for the five workflow keys the entity-linking rule
(planning/decomposition.py) actually connects today (PROJECT_CREATE,
SITE_CREATE, CREATE_USER, ADD_PROJECT_MEMBER, SITE_UPDATE); anything else
falls back to the registry's own `title` plus its first informative field,
which is honest and general rather than a guess at natural language for a
workflow this layer was never tested against.

    A StepRef's real value does not exist until that step executes (ADR-C2),
    so this is deliberately NOT the same resolution binding.py does -- it is
    a preview-only guess from information already available at preview time:
    the referenced step's OWN extracted fields, which were known the moment
    it was decomposed, well before it runs. Two patterns cover the two real
    producers of a StepRef today:

    - ``output_key`` matches a field name the referenced step ALREADY carries
      literally (e.g. ADD_PROJECT_MEMBER's member_name references CREATE_
      USER's full_name -- and "full_name" is also CREATE_USER's own field
      name, by construction of planning/outputs.py's echo-scalars rule).
    - A scope ref (project_id/site_id) has no such literal field of the same
      name -- the referenced step calls it "name", not "project_id" -- so
      falls back to that.
