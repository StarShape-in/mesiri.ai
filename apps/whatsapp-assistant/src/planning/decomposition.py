"""Entity-linking: turning N independently-extracted segments into one
ordered Plan (docs/execution/COMPOSITE_REQUEST_PLAN_LAYER.md §9, §7.2).

Pure -- no I/O, no provider calls. Each segment has already been through the
SAME single-intent path every ordinary message uses
(canonicalization.build_canonical_event against the extraction call
DecompositionResult.segments[i] produced), so this module receives a plain
list of CanonicalEventV2, one per segment, in the order the sender said them.
Deliberately NOT wired into runtime/inbound_journey/process.py yet -- that
wiring, and the plan preview (§8), are separate passes.

The problem this solves: a segment described in isolation is often
incomplete on purpose. "create a site called Site A" names no project --
the sender said "then create a site... under it", and by the time this
module sees it, "it" has already been dropped by per-segment extraction
(each segment is extracted independently, exactly as if it had arrived as
its own message). Something has to notice that SITE_CREATE `requires`
PROJECT (workflows/registry.py), that this segment did not resolve one, and
that an earlier segment's PROJECT_CREATE step will produce one -- and wire a
StepRef instead of letting site_create ask "which project?" for something
the sender already answered in the same breath.

Scope, stated plainly (mirrors ENTITY_RESOLUTION_PLAN.md ADR-E3's own
"depth 1 only in V1" honesty about staying narrow rather than pretending to
be more general than it is):

- PROJECT and SITE bind automatically: if a segment's own event doesn't
  already carry a project_id/site_id and an earlier segment's workflow
  `provides` one, bind to the MOST RECENT such earlier segment. There is
  essentially always at most one project/site in play in a short composite
  message, so "the one just created" is the correct, unambiguous reading of
  "it"/"there".
- USER binds only into ADD_PROJECT_MEMBER's `member_name`, and only when
  either (a) this segment named no member at all (a bare "make him project
  manager" -- extraction returned nothing for member_name), or (b) the name
  it did extract plausibly refers to the same person an earlier CREATE_USER
  segment just created (same normalized name). A member_name that clearly
  names someone ELSE is left alone -- that person is assumed to already
  exist, and resolving them is the entity-resolution layer's job at
  execution time, not this module's.
- Any other combination -- a workflow whose `requires` this module has no
  binding rule for -- is left unbound. The segment still gets a PlanStep;
  its own workflow asks the user for whatever is missing, exactly as an
  ordinary single-message report would. A missing binding is never an
  error; it degrades to the existing, safe clarifying-question path.
