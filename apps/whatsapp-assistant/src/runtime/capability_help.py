"""Capability help — answering "what can you do?" and "how do I ...?".

The WhatsApp assistant has 24 user-pickable workflows but only ever taught
users about the handful that happened to be written into a menu by hand. A
user who does not already know a capability exists has no way to discover
it, which is the core friction of a WhatsApp-first product: there is no UI
to browse.

This service turns a free-form question into the workflows that answer it.
It reads the same ``workflows/registry.py`` table every other discovery
surface renders from, so a workflow becomes answerable here on the day it
is registered -- there is no separate help document to maintain, and no way
for help to describe a capability that does not exist.

Layering: this lives in ``runtime/`` because it does I/O (one LLM call
behind ``JsonGenerationProvider``). It is deliberately *not* a workflow --
workflow nodes may not call AI or query anything (see the node docstrings
and the rule cited in ``inbound_journey/process.py``), so a help answerer
built as a graph could only format what someone else looked up. It is also
not in ``channel/replies.py``, which is pure rendering with no I/O. The
matched keys are handed to the renderer, matching how ``actor_profile`` is
injected for WHO_AM_I.

_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You match a construction site worker's question to the assistant's capabilities.

You are given a CATALOGUE of everything the assistant can do. Each entry has a `key`, a `title`, a `description`, and `examples` of messages that trigger it.

Return the keys whose capability would answer the user's question, best first, at most {max_matches}.

RULES:
1. Only ever return keys that appear verbatim in the CATALOGUE. Never invent one.
2. Return [] if the question is not about what the assistant can do -- if it is small talk, a question about the construction work itself, or a report rather than a question. [] is the right answer far more often than a bad guess: an empty result shows the user the full menu, a wrong one sends them down the wrong path.
3. The user is asking HOW TO DO something or WHETHER something is possible. "How do I record a delivery?" matches the material receipt capability. "Can I undo a payment?" matches the reversal capability.
4. A broad question ("what can you do?", "help") returns [] -- that is answered with the full menu, not a guess at three capabilities.
5. Judge by meaning, not shared words. Users write in Indian English, transliterated Hindi/Malayalam, and mixed script, and voice notes arrive already translated but often clumsily.

Output JSON only, in this exact shape:
{{"keys": ["capability.key", "another.key"]}}
