"""Inbound WhatsApp message handling -- the callbacks WhatsAppReceiver invokes
once a message is normalized and deduplicated (see runtime/dependencies.py's
build_container, which wires WhatsAppReceiver(on_normalized=..., ...) to
`build_message_handlers`'s return value).

Split out of runtime/dependencies.py (2026-07-29) purely for file size --
build_container was one 1,800+ line function, and this handler logic (the
identity gate, every deterministic fast path, and the call into
process_inbound_message) was over half of it. These were originally closures
over build_container's own locals; `build_message_handlers` below takes the
same values as explicit parameters instead, which is functionally identical
-- a closure over a parameter behaves exactly like a closure over a local --
but keeps wiring (build_container) and message handling (this module) in
separate files. The nested closures' bodies are unchanged from the original.
