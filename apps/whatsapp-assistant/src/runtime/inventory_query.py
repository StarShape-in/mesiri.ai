"""Material inventory read service (wiring layer only).

Adapts the backend's PostgresMaterialReadRepository (already used by the
mobile app's /materials/inventory endpoint) into a plain async method the
inbound journey can call. Lives in runtime/ because that's the one layer
allowed to import concrete backend infrastructure directly -- the same
justification runtime/dependencies.py already relies on for the material
execution wiring.
