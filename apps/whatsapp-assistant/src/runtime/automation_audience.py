"""Resolves an automation's `audience` column into concrete recipient user
ids -- wiring layer only, composes the same membership rules
context/postgres_repositories.py and projects/router.py already use, no new
SQL concept.

Four audiences, four completely different shapes (see migration 0455's
module docstring for why `audience` is a discriminator, not a foreign key):

- SELF: the automation's own creator. No query needed.
- USERS: the row's own explicit `audience_user_ids`. No query needed.
- ROLE: every active user of that role reachable from the automation's
  scope (org-wide if no project_id, that project's members otherwise).
- NON_REPORTERS: SITE_ENGINEERs reachable from whichever sites
  ReportingComplianceQueryService found not-reported.
