"""Deterministic account-admin command journey (Finance Module Slice 6, account-admin scope).

"create account X" / "rename X to Y" / "deactivate X" bypass the AI
understanding pipeline entirely -- same principle as
handle_whoami_trigger/handle_greeting_trigger ("a plain deterministic
command costs no tokens"). Unlike those, this still needs to reach
WorkflowRuntime (every business-affecting write is confirmed before it
commits -- architecture rule #4), so it lives alongside inbound_journey.py
rather than as a synchronous InteractionHandler fast-path method, and
constructs a minimal CanonicalEventV2 + PlannerDecisionV2 directly instead
of going through canonicalization/planner.decide() -- there is nothing for
the AI understanding pipeline to extract here; the regex parser already has
every field.

As of 2026-07-26 this is no longer the only way to reach account-admin: it
remains a zero-token fast path checked first (see runtime/dependencies.py),
but any phrasing it doesn't recognize -- different wording, voice, non-
English -- now falls through to the normal AI-understood journey via
SemanticType.ACCOUNT_ADMIN (see canonicalization/mapping.py,
platform/ai's extraction prompts, and runtime/inbound_journey.py's own
_ACCOUNT_ADMIN_ROLES gate, which enforces the identical role set this
module's _ACCOUNT_ADMIN_ROLES does for that path). Both converge on the
same WorkflowKey.ACCOUNT_ADMIN graph and the same
application/finance/validation.py role check.

Execution (the actual create/rename/deactivate SQL) does NOT happen here --
once WorkflowRuntime.start() returns STARTED, the draft sits AWAITING_CONFIRMATION
exactly like an expense capture draft, and the user's "YES" reply is picked
up by the *existing* InteractionHandler.handle_fast_path -> ActionTypeRoutingDispatcher
path (see runtime/dependencies.py's execution_dispatcher wiring) -- no new
code needed there, since that routing is already generic on DraftActionType.
