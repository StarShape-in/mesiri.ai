"""Evidence-attach service (#2 Batch Media, wiring layer only).

Same shape and justification as runtime/activity_query.py and
runtime/money_account_query.py: adapts the backend's
PostgresProgressExecutionRepository.persist_attach_evidence into a plain
async method the assistant can call directly.

Unlike every other confirmed-action dispatch (Material, Expense, Labour,
Progress's own CreateActivity/AddProgressUpdate), attaching evidence photos
is never behind a YES/NO confirmation -- a photo is unambiguous evidence,
not a business fact someone could have misheard (see
AttachEvidenceCommand's docstring in shared/contracts). So this is called
directly from the WhatsApp image-purpose tap handler (runtime/dependencies.py),
not through interactions/ExecutionDispatcher/WorkflowRuntime -- there is no
draft, no workflow_instance, nothing to confirm.
