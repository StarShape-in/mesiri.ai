"""DPR lookup service for the dpr.request workflow ("send me today's DPR").

Same shape and justification as runtime/labour_query_service.py: a plain
async method the assistant can call so a node never queries a repository
itself (see workflows/runtime.py). Read-only -- never opens a write
transaction, never renders or generates anything itself.

Scope: TODAY only, one site. #16 Daily Report Generation's DPR is already
narrowed to SITE-level (see backend/.../dpr.py's module docstring); this
narrows further to "today" specifically, since "send me yesterday's DPR"
or "send me last week's" needs a date/range extraction this V1 chat
trigger doesn't have. Asking for a DPR on a day with no activity, or before
today's generation cron has run, both resolve to `not_generated` --
distinguished from `pending_render` (a version exists but hasn't been
through channel/dpr_document/'s Playwright render yet) so the reply can
tell the difference between "nothing was logged" and "it's on its way."
