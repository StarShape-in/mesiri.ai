"""Workforce register lookups for the Labour attendance workflow.

The matching node needs candidates from the register to decide whether a
reported "Ravi" is someone already known (Labour plan principle P4 — never
identified by name alone). A node must never query a repository itself (see
workflows/runtime.py), so the read happens here and is seeded into the event's
fields by runtime/inbound_journey.py's `_seed_worker_candidates`, exactly as
money accounts are for expense.

**2026-07-27: this is now backed by the real database.** It shipped as a stub
while Labour was built conversation-first, and the stub is kept below only for
local/test use where no database exists. The register (``workforce_workers``)
is real, has dashboard CRUD (domains/workforce/router.py), and attendance
history (``labour_attendance_lines``) is real too — so "has this worker been
seen on this site before", the single strongest corroborating signal matching
has, is now a genuine answer rather than a configured guess.

Why that signal matters enough to compute here rather than defer: P4 caps a
name-only match below auto-accept by construction, so without corroboration
*every* named worker asks a question. `seen_on_site` / `seen_on_project` are
what let a returning worker match silently, which is what keeps a ten-worker
report to zero questions instead of ten (P9).

Two properties this deliberately preserves from the stub era:

- **Read-only.** There is no write path here at all. Attendance never writes
  the register (principle P1); promotion is a separate, explicitly confirmed
  act performed from the dashboard.
- **Never invents a worker.** An organization with an empty register gets an
  empty list, every named worker becomes a temporary worker, and nothing is
  asked (principle P3). That is correct behaviour, not a degraded mode.
