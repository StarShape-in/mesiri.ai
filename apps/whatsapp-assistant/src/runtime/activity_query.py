"""Open-activity lookup for the Activity Continuation workflow (wiring layer only).

Same shape and justification as runtime/vendor_query.py: adapts a plain read
query into an async method the inbound journey can call before the graph
runs (a node must never query a repository itself -- see
workflows/runtime.py). Never opens a write transaction.

Implements the "find today's open activity for this reporter/site" lookup
docs/execution/DAILY_REPORTING_PLAN.md's P10/§1B.2 describe: a continuation
message ("finished plastering", "completed another 40 sqm") should never
have to name which activity it means when there is exactly one plausible
answer.

Scoped by reporter AND site, not just project: two engineers on the same
site must never have their activities conflated, and neither should two
sites on the same project.

`find_open_activity` (singular, most-recent-wins) still backs #2 Batch
Media's photo-evidence attach (runtime/dependencies.py) -- there is no
message text to compare a photo against, so recency really is the best
available signal there, and a photo landing on the wrong-but-recent
activity is a low-stakes mistake. `find_open_activities` (plural) backs the
create-vs-continue resolver instead (workflows/site_update/matching.py):
when there IS message text, recency alone is not enough (see
docs/execution/ACTIVITY_RESOLUTION_AND_CORRECTION_PLAN.md's F1) -- the
resolver needs every open candidate, not just the newest, to compare
against what the message actually describes.

Deliberately NOT filtered by "today's date": an IN_PROGRESS activity that
spans past midnight (a late finish, or simply never marked complete) must
still be continuable the next message regardless of the server's calendar
date -- the same class of bug canonicalization/occurred_date.py's docstring
describes for a *stated* date applies here to an *inferred* one. "Open"
(status) is the only signal that matters; recency (`updated_at`) only breaks
ties when more than one activity is open at once.
