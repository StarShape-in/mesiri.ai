"""Wires the decomposer into the live message path
(docs/execution/COMPOSITE_REQUEST_PLAN_LAYER.md §9, §14).

Called from process_inbound_message right after the canonicalization stage,
only when the primary (single-segment) canonicalization came back
UNRECOGNIZED with semantic_type UNKNOWN -- exactly the trace evidence §9
records: a multi-intent message has no representable single semantic_type,
so "unknown" is extraction's honest answer for it, and today that answer
produces the dead-end generic reply. This is the one place that answer gets
a second chance before falling back to it.

## Project/site resolution (added 2026-07-30)

§14's risk table named a real gap: the single-message path's project-
selection and site-selection gates (runtime/inbound_journey/seeding.py)
never ran for a decomposed segment at all. Closed here, once per
decomposition rather than once per segment -- project/site ambiguity is a
property of the SENDER (which projects/sites they're authorized on), not of
any individual segment, so every segment of one message shares the same
answer. _resolve_project_and_site runs before any segment is canonicalized;
if it can't resolve automatically (more than one project, or the resolved
project has more than one site), the already-decomposed segment texts are
held in PendingDecompositionStore while a picker asks -- mirroring
_run_project_gate/_run_site_gate's own "hold + ask" shape, generalized from
one CanonicalEventV2 to N segment texts.

## Material-unit/stock gates (added 2026-07-31, Phase A5)

The other half of §14's gap, closed by
docs/execution/UNIFIED_UNDERSTANDING_PIPELINE.md's Phase A5: unlike
project/site, an ambiguous catalog name or an over-stock usage report is
genuinely PER-SEGMENT (it depends on that one segment's own material_name/
quantity, never the sender as a whole), so it cannot be resolved once up
front the way project/site is. _process_remaining_segments below builds
each segment's CanonicalEventV2 one at a time, in order, and runs the same
single-message gates (seeding.py's _run_material_unit_gates/_run_stock_gate,
completely unmodified) on it before moving to the next. When a segment's own
gate needs to pause, EVERYTHING needed to continue -- every earlier
segment's already-fully-resolved event (`built_events`), the one segment
paused mid-gate (`pending_event`), and every segment text not yet even
touched (`segments`) -- is held in the same PendingDecompositionStore the
project/site gate already uses, and one of five new resume legs
(resume_pending_decomposition_with_material/_material_create/
_material_unit_choice/_unit/_stock_choice) answers it, mirroring
resume.py's own five single-message legs almost exactly -- the difference
is always "then continue the decomposition loop" where resume.py says
"then call _plan_and_run".

_run_segment_gates reuses seeding.py's gate functions completely
unmodified, via `_NullPendingReportStore`: those functions were written to
pause by writing into interactions/pending_report.py's PendingReportStore
(one CanonicalEventV2, no notion of "N more segments still to come"), which
is the wrong store for a decomposition segment's pause -- so a throwaway
stub swallows that write, and THIS module persists the real pause state
(built_events/pending_event/segments) itself. No gate function in
seeding.py was changed to make this work.

Deliberately NOT touching interactions/handler.py, runtime/plan_executor.py,
or any already-STARTED workflow's own gates -- this closes the gap only for
segments still being turned into a Plan, before anything has started. A
Plan's later steps (once the whole-plan preview is confirmed) run through
plan_executor.py exactly as before; project/site is already trivially
satisfied there since every segment's event already carries a resolved
project_id/site_id (either from this module's own resolution, or a StepRef
for one created earlier in the same message) by the time _build_and_preview_
plan calls build_plan_from_segments.

Every failure mode here degrades to `None` -- "not applicable, fall through
to today's unrecognized-message reply unchanged" -- never an exception that
could take down an otherwise-working message. A message that reaches this
function has already failed single-intent understanding once; there is
nothing this module could do that makes that outcome worse, and several
things (a bad decomposition, a provider outage) that must not make it worse
either.
