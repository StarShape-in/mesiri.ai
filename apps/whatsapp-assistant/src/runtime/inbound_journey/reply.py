    runtime/dependencies.py's handle_slot_answer fast path) renders it the

    cancel" plain-text bug a user hit right after answering the account
    slot.

    STARTED and BLOCKED_PENDING_CONFIRMATION are the two statuses actually
    asking the user to confirm a draft -- those get Yes/No buttons.
    AWAITING_INPUT (when the node supplied slot_options -- see
    workflows/slots.py's `slot_options`) gets a tappable list, when every
