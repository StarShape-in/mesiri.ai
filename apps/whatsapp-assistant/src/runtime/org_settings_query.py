"""Per-organization settings read service (wiring layer only).

Same shape and justification as runtime/material_catalog_query.py: adapts
the backend's PostgresOrganizationSettingsRepository into plain async
methods the inbound journey's gates can call, without the WhatsApp
assistant depending on backend infrastructure anywhere outside runtime/.

Read-only by design — settings are changed from the control panel, never
from a WhatsApp message.
