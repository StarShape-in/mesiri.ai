"""Attendance read service for the labour.query workflow.

Same shape and justification as runtime/expense_query_service.py: a plain
async method the assistant can call, reading confirmed attendance so a node
never queries a repository itself (see workflows/runtime.py). Never opens a
write transaction.

Answers "how many workers today?", "labour cost this week", "who worked
yesterday" — the questions a supervisor asks about work already recorded.
Until this existed, an attendance was visible exactly once, in the
confirmation message at the moment it was sent; afterwards the assistant had
nothing to say about it even though the record was sitting in the database.

**Scope is not optional.** Every read is filtered by organization, and by the
caller's current project/site the same way expense queries are. Attendance
carries names and wages, so a query that leaked across projects would leak
who works where and for how much.
