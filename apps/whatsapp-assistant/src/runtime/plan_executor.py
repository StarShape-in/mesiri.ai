"""The generic plan executor
(docs/execution/COMPOSITE_REQUEST_PLAN_LAYER.md §7.1/§7.4, P4/P6).

Drives a Plan of N steps to completion, one step at a time. Called from
runtime/message_journey.py's post-confirmation hook every time any workflow
confirmation resolves; a cheap no-op (one Redis read) when no plan is
waiting, which is the overwhelmingly common case.

## What this replaced

`resume.py` used to have its own advance_member_plan_after_user_created,
hardcoded to exactly two named step ids for exactly one chain. Correct at
the scale it was written for, but not general: an N-step decomposed plan
needs to advance from *whatever* step is running to *whatever* is next,
without either being named in code. This module is that loop; the retired
function's own chain is now just a plan of size 2 running through it
(§4.2's one-plan-one-executor invariant -- the whole reason PlanStore was
built N-capable from the start rather than as a size-1 store to widen
later). message_journey.py now calls this module's `advance_plan`
generically for every confirmation instead. See
tests/unit/test_member_create_plan.py and tests/integration/
test_member_create_plan_real_runtime.py for the falsification tests that
prove the swap: the retired function's own scenario, driven through this
generic path, against both fakes and a real WorkflowRuntime with real
compiled LangGraph graphs.

## Why every decision matches on workflow_instance_id

A plan outlives the turn that created it (PlanStore's 30-minute TTL), and a
user can abandon a running step and legitimately start a *different*
workflow of the same key inside that window. Matching on workflow_key +
RUNNING alone let an abandoned "create Hysam" plan attach itself to a later
unrelated "create Rajesh" and offer Rajesh project-manager rights on Hysam's
project (fixed in 1ba6462). An N-step plan has N times that exposure, so the
instance match is the executor's single most load-bearing guard.

## Failure semantics (ADR-C4)

A step that is rejected, cancelled, or fails to start marks FAILED, which
cascades CANCELLED to every step transitively depending on it -- those are
never attempted, because they would either fail anyway or attach to the
wrong parent. Steps that do NOT depend on it still run. The plan then
continues from the next runnable step rather than stopping, and the closing
summary reports every step's real outcome, success and failure alike (P4:
never a blanket "all done" that papers over a partial failure).
