"""Progress/activity read service for the activity.query workflow (#17
Search / Ask Mesiri).

Same shape and justification as runtime/labour_query_service.py: a plain
async method the assistant can call, reading already-saved activities and
open site issues so a node never queries a repository itself (see
workflows/runtime.py). Never opens a write transaction.

Answers "what did I log today?", "what happened on site X yesterday?", "any
open issues on site Y?" -- the questions a supervisor asks about work
already recorded, complementing labour_query (attendance) and expense_query
(spending) for the Daily Reporting module's own records.

**Scope is not optional.** Every read is filtered by organization, and by
the caller's current project/site the same way labour_query is -- a search
that leaked across projects would leak what is happening on someone else's
site.

Open issues are NOT date-scoped: a blocker raised three days ago that is
still open is still relevant today, unlike an activity log entry which is
inherently a record of a specific day.
