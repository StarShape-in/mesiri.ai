"""Drains and sends #9 Notifications' queued 'pending' rows over WhatsApp.

Invocable manually or via a cron entry -- not a persistent worker, same
convention as backend/src/mesiri/scripts/run_notification_checks.py (which
queues the rows this script sends) and project_timeline_events.py. This is
deliberately a SEPARATE process/script from the backend check, not the same
one: the backend must never talk to Meta's Cloud API directly (architecture
boundary -- only this app holds WhatsApp credentials and the WhatsAppSender
adapter). `drain_and_send()` below is also called directly (same process,
no subprocess) by runtime/automation_runner.py's in-app scheduler, so
automations reuse this exact send/skip logic rather than a second copy.

For each pending row: resolve the recipient's wa_id, check quiet hours and
the WhatsApp 24h session window (application/notifications/checks.py, in
the backend package -- pure logic, safe to import from either side), and
either send or skip with a recorded reason. Never sends silently outside
the session window: Meta rejects a free-form send there, and pretending
otherwise would be worse than skipping honestly.

`rule_key`s starting with "automation:" (runtime/automation_runner.py's own
convention) render from the row's own `payload` -- `document_object_key`
when present sends a document (SEND_DPR with a rendered PDF ready),
otherwise `payload["message"]` as plain text. Every other rule_key keeps
using the static `_RULE_KEY_MESSAGES` table.

Recommended VPS crontab entry (ops-managed, not tracked in this repo) --
kept as a manual/backup path now that automation_runner.py drains
automation-sourced rows itself; #9's own stuck-confirmation nudges still
rely on this cron, since nothing else queues or sends those:
