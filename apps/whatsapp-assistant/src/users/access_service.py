"""Setting a user's project/site access — the one implementation.

Two surfaces grant access: the web dashboard (a tenant admin editing their
own org, scoped by the JWT's `org` claim) and the control panel (a platform
admin editing any org, scoped by an explicit org_id in the path). They must
apply identical rules, because the result decides which project a WhatsApp
report is filed against and what the dashboard lets someone read and write.

Duplicating the logic per surface is exactly how the org-wide role rule
ended up written out five times with one copy silently wrong (see
mesiri/authorization/roles.py). So it lives here once, and both routers
call it.

Three things happen together, and all three matter:

  1. ``users.access_policy`` is written — still read by GET /me, and read
     live as the org-wide bypass for a non-admin (roles.policy_is_org_wide).
  2. ``project_members`` / ``site_members`` are fully replaced — this is
     what AuthorizationService and the WhatsApp context resolver actually
     consult (migration 0350). Writing only access_policy made an earlier
     version of this a no-op: the dashboard showed the change while the
     user's real access was untouched.
  3. The identity projection re-runs, so the WhatsApp assistant sees the
     change immediately rather than at the next reconcile sweep.

"all_projects" deliberately writes zero project_members rows: it is a live
standing bypass, so a project created after the grant is still reachable
without re-saving it.
