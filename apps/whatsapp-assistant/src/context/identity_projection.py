        A user's org-wide role (see _ORG_WIDE_ROLES) grants every project in
        their org, all sites -- the same bypass AuthorizationService applies
        on the REST side, kept in sync so a project created after this user's
        last sync is still visible without needing a fresh project_members
        row per admin per project. access_policy.mode == "all_projects" gets
        the identical treatment for a non-admin: it's a live bypass, not a
        project_members snapshot (users/router.py's update_user_access no
        longer writes one), so it must be re-checked here the same way the
        role is, not read off project_members like a normal grant.

        Full replace (delete then reinsert), not a diff -- membership is a
        set, and the set can shrink (a project/site removed via the
        dashboard) as easily as it can grow. Runs inside the same
        transaction as the caller (project_one/reconcile_all's `with
        self._engine.begin()`), so a mid-sync failure can't leave a user with
        a half-updated membership set.
