"""Redis-backed "waiting for a team photo" hint.

After attendance is recorded and the promotion offer is settled, Mesiri asks
whether the supervisor wants to attach a photo of the crew. This remembers
WHICH attendance report that offer was about, so the very next photo they
send attaches to it directly -- skipping the "what is this photo for?"
picker, which would be a strange thing to ask about a photo sent in answer to
a question Mesiri itself just posed.

Mirrors interactions/completion_photo_hint.py exactly, including its
"Redis is a hint, never authoritative" stance: a missing or expired hint
must never break the journey. The worst case is that the photo goes through
the normal picker instead, which still works.

Deliberately NOT stored on the attendance record. The record is append-only
(P5) and complete the moment it is confirmed -- whether a photo was later
offered is a fact about the conversation, not about who worked that day.

Key layout (the client prepends the ``mesiri`` namespace):
