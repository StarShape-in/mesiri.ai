"""Unit tests for the per-organization settings catalog
(backend domains/organizations/settings.py, migration 0364).

The defaults are the real contract: no row exists for any org until someone
changes something in the control panel, so a wrong default silently changes
behaviour for every existing tenant. Validation matters for the same reason
in reverse — a bad value persisted here is read by the WhatsApp gate on
every material report.
