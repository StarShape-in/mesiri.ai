"""Every domain router the dashboard depends on must be mounted on the app
that actually runs in production.

This is not a hypothetical risk -- it has happened four times in
runtime/lifecycle.py's create_app(), each one silent until a real user hit
it: expenses, finance, and vendors routers were each built against
backend/src/mesiri/http/app.py (which infra/mesiri.service does not run) and
never added to this one, and every dashboard call for that domain 404'd in
production. Labour was the fourth (reported by Alan 2026-07-27 -- "Add
Worker" said not found, and a WhatsApp-confirmed attendance never showed up
on the dashboard, both because /labour/* simply wasn't reachable).

Each fix landed as a one-line addition with no test to catch a fifth
occurrence. This is that test. It doesn't need a live database: router
mounting in create_app() is synchronous route registration, not a network
call -- the actual DB connections only happen in the ASGI lifespan, which
this never starts.

Inspecting `app.routes` directly does NOT work as a check here: this
FastAPI version defers included routers into a lazy `_IncludedRouter`
wrapper that only resolves at request-dispatch or schema-generation time, so
a mounted router can look absent from `app.routes` while working correctly.
Forcing `app.openapi()` is what actually resolves everything, and is also
the more honest check -- it's the same resolution path a real request goes
through.
