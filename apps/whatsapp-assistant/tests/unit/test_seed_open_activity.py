"""_seed_open_activity -- unit tests.

Covers the rewritten seeding layer (docs/execution/
ACTIVITY_RESOLUTION_AND_CORRECTION_PLAN.md): it now runs for the single
merged WorkflowKey.SITE_UPDATE (not a separate ACTIVITY_CONTINUATION key,
which is retired) and seeds every open activity as a candidate list
(`_open_activity_candidates`) rather than picking one by recency -- that
recency-only pick was F1's root cause. workflows/site_update/nodes.py's
resolve_target is what actually scores the candidates; this only covers the
wiring that supplies them. Mirrors test_seed_activity_search.py's shape: a
fake ActivityQueryService stands in for the Postgres-backed one.
