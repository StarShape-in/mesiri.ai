"""Unit tests for the CREATE_USER -> ADD_PROJECT_MEMBER chain
(ENTITY_RESOLUTION_PLAN.md sections 3.3/8.1): start_member_create_plan, and
the generic runtime/plan_executor.advance_plan that drives it once started.

The live bug this completes: a Malayalam message named a real user who did
not yet have a Mesiri account. Missing's "Yes, create" tap must not just
create the user and stop -- it has to finish the original "add them to the
project" request the user actually sent.

Advancing the plan used to be resume.py's own hand-written
advance_member_plan_after_user_created, hardcoded to this one chain's two
step ids. That function is retired: message_journey.py now calls
runtime/plan_executor.py's advance_plan generically for every confirmation
(docs/execution/COMPOSITE_REQUEST_PLAN_LAYER.md §4.2's one-plan-one-executor
invariant) -- the SAME executor a decomposed multi-intent plan (§9) drives.
test_plan_executor.py owns that mechanism's own unit coverage; this file's
job is proving THIS chain still gets the exact behaviour the retired
function was written to guarantee. See also
tests/integration/test_member_create_plan_real_runtime.py, which drives the
same sequence through the real WorkflowRuntime and compiled LangGraph
graphs rather than fakes.

Fakes only here: no live DB, no LangGraph, no HTTP.
