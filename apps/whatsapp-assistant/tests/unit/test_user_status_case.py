"""User status casing — reactivating someone must not lock them out.

Real incident: an admin deactivated a user in the control panel and then
reactivated them. Afterwards the assistant no longer recognized their
number and replied as though they were a stranger.

Cause: the control panel wrote `body.status.capitalize()` -> "Active", but
users are stored lowercase ("active"); only organizations use the
capitalized form. The assistant's lookup was `WHERE u.status = 'active'`, a
case-sensitive comparison, so the row was never found. Deactivation
"worked" by accident ("Inactive" isn't "active" either) -- only
reactivation was broken.

Fixed on three sides, each covered here: reads are case-insensitive (so
already-broken rows recover), writes are normalized lowercase (so it stops
recurring), and migration 0368 repairs existing rows.
