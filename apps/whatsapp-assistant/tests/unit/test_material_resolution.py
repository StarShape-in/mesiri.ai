"""runtime/entity_resolution/material_resolution.py -- Phase 3 of
ENTITY_RESOLUTION_PLAN.md: the materials catalog expressed in the shared
Resolved/Ambiguous/Missing vocabulary.

Pure function, no DB and no fakes needed -- the SQL matching happens before
this and is the catalog repository's own concern (see that module's docstring
on why materials need only half of the entity-resolution layer).

The behavioural proof that this migration changed nothing lives in
test_material_create_gate.py / test_material_unit_gates.py, which exercise
_run_material_unit_gates end-to-end and were not modified for Phase 3.
