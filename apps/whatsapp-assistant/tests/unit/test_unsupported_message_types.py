"""Unit tests for message types Mesiri can't act on yet (PDF, video, sticker,
location pin, shared contact, music file).

Real problem this fixes: normalization raised on any type outside
text/image/voice-note/interactive. That exception aborted ingress inside
WhatsAppReceiver._process_message's catch-all, which logged a trace row and
returned -- with no reply ever sent. The sender got pure silence and no way
to tell "Mesiri can't read PDFs" from "Mesiri is down", so they couldn't
know whether their report had landed.

These messages now normalize to InputModality.UNKNOWN and the runtime
declines them politely, except for reactions and Meta system notices, which
are deliberately answered with nothing (see SILENTLY_IGNORED_RAW_TYPES).
