"""The "who reaches every project" rule must be identical on all surfaces.

Which project and site a WhatsApp report gets filed against, what the web
dashboard lets someone read and write, and what the control panel reports
about their access are all answers to the same question. That rule used to
be written out independently in five places, and one of them silently
disagreed:

  the control panel read access_policy only, without the role half, so an
  ADMIN carrying the default policy ({"mode": "custom_projects",
  "projects": []} — set for every user at creation) rendered as
  "No projects assigned" while both the assistant and the dashboard gave
  that same person every project in the organization.

Under-reporting privilege is the dangerous direction: an operator auditing
permissions sees "no access" and moves on.

The rule now lives in mesiri/authorization/roles.py. These tests pin its
behaviour and fail if a private copy reappears anywhere.
