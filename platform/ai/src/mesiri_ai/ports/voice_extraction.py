"""Merged voice-transcription + structured-extraction provider port (M3 perf).

Distinct from SpeechUnderstandingProvider + StructuredExtractionProvider used
together: a single adapter (Gemini) can transcribe and extract in one model
call, given audio in and the extraction schema in the same prompt -- this
port is what lets understanding/pipeline.py's voice path use that one call
instead of two sequential round trips (previously ~4.5s combined; see the
Gemini adapter's understand_voice()).

Only DynamicAIProviderResolver and GeminiProvider implement this. A raw
single-capability adapter (SarvamSpeechProvider) cannot -- it has no
extraction capability of its own to compose with -- so the resolver's
implementation falls back to calling transcribe() then extract() internally
and merging the two results when voice isn't routed to Gemini, keeping the
same external contract either way.
