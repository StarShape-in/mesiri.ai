"""UnderstandingResult.v1 — the M3 output contract.

Produced by the Understanding Pipeline from a ``NormalizedMessage``. Captures the
transcript/translation, document classification, structured extraction
candidates, confidence, and provider telemetry — but never business truth,
context resolution, or workflow selection (those are downstream).

Ownership: Ilan.  Required reviewer: Alan.  Version: v1.
