"""CanonicalEvent.v1 — the normalized business-intent signal between Context and Planner.

Produced by the canonicalization layer from an ``UnderstandingResult`` +
``ResolvedContext``. A CanonicalEvent is an internal orchestration signal, not a
confirmed fact — e.g. ``MaterialReceiptRequested`` means "the assistant believes
the user wants to record a material receipt." The user may still correct it, the
workflow may reject it, authorization may fail. This is never a ``DomainEvent``
(a confirmed fact, published only after commit).

Per the architecture's layer-ownership table, CanonicalEvent normalizes AI
output into business intent but must never carry knowledge of AI providers or
confidence scores. ``completeness`` is therefore a business-level judgement
(are the required fields present?) — the raw M3 ``ConfidenceLevel`` is
deliberately not represented here.

Ownership: SHARED ARCHITECTURE — part of the M0 contract surface. Version: v1.
