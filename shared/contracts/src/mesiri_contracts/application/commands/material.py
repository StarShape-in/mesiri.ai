"""Material Application Commands (M8) — the typed handoff from ConfirmedActionV2.

Two distinct commands, not one with a direction flag — mirrors the existing
"two tables, not one" decision for material_receipts/material_usage (they
carry genuinely different optional fields: supplier/cost vs work_item).

`project_id` is deliberately nullable here even though material_receipts/
material_usage require it NOT NULL — Domain validation rejects a missing
project_id (a real, routine outcome of unresolved M4 context), the mapper
must never invent one.

Ownership: SHARED ARCHITECTURE — part of the M0 contract surface. Version: v2.
