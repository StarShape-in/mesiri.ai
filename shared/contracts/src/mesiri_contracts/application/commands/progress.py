"""Progress Application Commands — the typed handoff from ConfirmedActionV2.

Placed here rather than under the backend's application package, matching
Material and Labour (see labour.py's docstring: "where Material and Expense
disagree ... follow Material" — commands are shared contract surface, not
backend-internal).

Two commands, not one, because Activity creation and a Progress Update are
structurally different acts (docs/execution/DAILY_REPORTING_PLAN.md ADR-D1,
ADR-D12): creating an Activity carries the full header (location, work
package, contractor, initial quantities); appending a Progress Update carries
only what changed at that moment, against an activity that already exists.
Collapsing them into one command with optional fields would blur exactly the
distinction P1 depends on — an Activity's header is mutable (via a
correction, see ADR-D14), a Progress Update never is.

`work_type` is free text in V1 (plan open decision #4) — no catalog exists to
validate it against, unlike Material's `material_name`. `unit`/`unit_id`
follow Material's exact resolution shape: `unit` is what the user said,
`unit_id` is filled in by the Handler's resolver
(application/progress/resolution.py) before persistence, reusing
`units_of_measure`/`unit_aliases` (0290) rather than building a second
resolution path.

Ownership: SHARED ARCHITECTURE — part of the M0 contract surface. Version: v2.
